# Alarm Grouper
An android app that will allow the user to group alarms.

Birth:
I tried a polyphasic sleep schedule (3\*2hour sleep sessions) and often had to change multiple alarms each day my sleeping schedule differed slightly. Because I did not want to create many alarms that would clutter my alarms screen, I had a need for an app that would allow me to group alarms, and change the time at which they start easily.

Requirements:
 1. Must be capible of letting my phone make a sound at a specified time
 2. Should allow for the creation of alarm groups/clusters
 3. Alarm groups:
   i. Should be specified like the range function in python, that is, a starting time, end time, and interval between alarms should be specified
  ii. The alarms should make the same sound
